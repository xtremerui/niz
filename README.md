# niz

Loving the HHKB layout too much after I tried tokyo60 HHKB keyboard on [Drop.com](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-tokyo-keyboard-tokyo60-keyboard-kit/), so I reprogram my niz plum 84 keyboard to a HHKB layout.

Now I got a HHKB keyboard with capacity key by only 150 CAD! Ideally you could get an even closer one to the HHKB pro2 by reprogramming niz atom66.

### The key configuration for upper level has following maps that is different to hhkb:

| Original        | Now           | 
| -------------   |:-------------:|
| ESC             | `             |

since I am used to use <cmd+`> under macos to switch between windows for same app e.g. chrome multi users. And by mapping backspace to \\, there is no key available for tilt key anymore.

### For lower level I only configured keys I use most under hhkb

CapsLock

arrow up, down, left, right

home, end, pagup, pagdn

volumn down, up; mute; play/pause(configured on F key, which is Eject under HHKB originally)

# usage

Clone the repo under windows, connect the keyboard and run the .exe. If you see errors, do a factory reset first. Everything else is in the manual. One thing though, make sure you press `Fn + F12` to enter custom mode before you load hhkb.pro and write key maps, otherwise it won't work. Enjoy!
